<p>This repository hosts an advanced artificial neural network (ANN) model designed to predict customer churn in a banking environment. The model leverages TensorFlow and Keras to analyze customer data and identify those who are likely to leave the bank. This predictive tool aims to help banks proactively address customer retention by identifying at-risk customers.</p>
